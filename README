Currently, every time we send an SMS we also show notification "sending sms: .....".
What should we add in our code-base so that when the SMS will get delivered, this notification's text will be changed to "sms sent: ......"?
[hint: in android's SmsManager you can supply a PendingIntent for delivery. this pending intent could start a broadcast or a service that will have some logic. what will you need to add for the intent's extras so the new service/broadcast-receiver can update the notification's message?]

Answer:
If we add the notification's id, we can access it and change it from within the broadcast that handles the delivery intent.
